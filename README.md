Hi, my name is Roger, and welcome to my Github page!

I would like to innovate on existing data science modeling methods and/or apply such methods to real and pressing questions in technology.

My work until now (as of mid-2021) has focused on automated processing of mass spectral data for atmospheric chemistry. 
As is standard in the field, most of the code is written in Igor Pro, which is a scientific data analysis software that serves a similar purpose to MATLAB.
It has a C-like programming language and can be controlled for many applications using either the command line or by using the interactive GUI.

I'm not sure how exactly intellectual property works within the university though.
The code gets shared freely between users, but I hesitate to make any particular code public.
However, 

You may contact me at rogersheu92@gmail.com
