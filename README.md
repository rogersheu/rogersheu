Hello, and welcome to my Github page!

Software Development
==============
Contributed to Synapse: Matrix homeserver. Matrix is an "open standard and communication protocol for real-time communication."
https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11157

Data Science Portfolio
===============
[NBA ML Predictions](https://github.com/rogersheu/NBA-ML-Predictions)
---------

| Python (scikit-learn, pandas, web scraping with BeautifulSoup) | R (RStudio, visualization using dplyr, ggplot2) | SQL (SQLite3, DBeaver)|
--- | --- | ---

Includes training, validation, and testing of random forests, SVM, MLP, and XGBoost models, bundled up in a nice single program that can be run daily to get an updated perspective on All-Star candidacies.

[Three Point Progression](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78449574/147013292-e74f2e64-fb3e-47f7-a5ab-751796399167.png) (links to Tableau)
----------

Using data obtained from scraping for the NBA ML Predictions repository, I plotted individual players' three point progression by year and by age. A [Tableau visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/roger3881/viz/NBA3PTProgression/ByYearandByAge) shows players who have made at least 1500 3's. Clicking on a player's name allows the user to see that player's progression in particular. In the graph with year on the x-axis, player line colors change as they get older.

[Pokemon GO Data](https://github.com/rogersheu/Pokemon-GO-Data)
----------

Scraping of data using Python (pandas, BeautifulSoup). Populated CSVs and exported those to Tableau. Some examples of Tableau visualizations include [Move Sets](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/roger3881/viz/PokemonGoAllPossibleMovesets/UltraLeague2500CP) and [Base Stats](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/roger3881/viz/PokemonStats_16360888246720/ATKVHP).

Scientific Work
==============
My work until now (as of mid-2021) has focused on automated processing of mass spectral data for atmospheric chemistry. 
The field of atmospheric chemistry is currently split between Igor Pro, which is a scientific data analysis software that serves a similar purpose to MATLAB, and R/Python. Though the field has trended away from Igor Pro in recent years, a vast majority of researchers still use it because of the wealth of packages and software that were already developed in its environment for a variety of field-standard instrumentation.

Igor Pro has a C-like programming language, features incredibly modular and aesthetically-pleasing figure creation, and can be controlled using either the command line or by using the interactive GUI. If you are here to get an idea of my coding capability and you are familiar with Igor Pro syntax, please take a look at rogersheu/TOF-analysis-code.

If you use the code here for academic (scientific publishing) purposes, please at least acknowledge me by including a citation to one of my papers or by acknowledging the use of my code.
