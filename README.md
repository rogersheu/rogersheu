Hi, my name is Roger, and welcome to my Github page!

I would like to innovate on existing data science modeling methods and/or apply such methods to real and pressing questions in technology.

My work until now (as of mid-2021) has focused on automated processing of mass spectral data for atmospheric chemistry. 
As is standard in the field, most of the code is written in Igor Pro, which is a scientific data analysis software that serves a similar purpose to MATLAB.
It has a C-like programming language, features incredibly modular and aesthetically-pleasing figure creation, and can be controlled using either the command line or by using the interactive GUI.

If you use any of the code for scientific purposes, please at least acknowledge me by including a citation to one of my papers or by acknowledging the use of my code.
